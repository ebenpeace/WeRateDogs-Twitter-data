# WeRateDogs-Twitter-data
Here, I performed data wrangling on WeRateDogs Twitter account as part of the requirements for the Udacity Nanodegree Data Analysis Program. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
I did not include the checkpoints and the likes, kindly note that this is because, I do not own the rights to the data, If you will like to use the data, kindly contact UDACITY for more information.
